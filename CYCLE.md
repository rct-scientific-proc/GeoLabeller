Cycle mode is helpful for sequentially auto zooming to layers in a selected group.
When in cycle mode whatever group is highlighted then it will zoom to the last on checked layer in that group.
Then when the user adds their labels, they can press space, and it will toggle off that layer, and then zoom to the next layer that is currently checked on in that group.
